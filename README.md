# Live Cursor - Web Socket
A small project to understand the working of WebSockets and how they establish a persistent server-client connection, enabling low-latency, full-duplex, bidirectional communication.

Unlike the classic HTTP request-response model, WebSockets maintain a single TCP connection, allowing continuous data transfer between client and server. Web-Sockets are used for creating realtime-applications like -

1. Live chat applications

2. Multiplayer gaming

3. Collaborative document editing

4. IoT device updates

5. Financial dashboards

This project is inspired by the Realtime Mouse Pointers feature in tools like Canva and Figma, which display multiple collaborators’ cursors on the screen. Similarly, this project demonstrates how multiple members can log in and track each other’s mouse movements in real time.
